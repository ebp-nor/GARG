Below we outline a different topological method, which is also covered in the official _tskit [counting topologies tutorial](https://tskit.dev/tutorials/counting_topologies.html). If you need a refresher, you can look there. Here's the same analysis repeated on the simulated chimp data. In this case it's pretty boring: all the genomes within a population are each others closest relatives."
