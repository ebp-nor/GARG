    "_Tskit_ is designed for use with very large genetic genealogies, potentially millions of genomes. Deducing an exact history in this case is probably impossible. Instead, analyses often focus on sampling likely genealogies rather than building a single correct one. This leads to a greater focus on methods such as simulation, compared to fields such as phylogenetics.\n",

We'll use the simulator as a base to investigate the principles behind ARGs.

This is what happens when we simplify without `keep_unary=True`. The result is a much more compact but essentially equivalent tree, that only shows nodes that represent branch points: i.e. those associated with coalescence.
