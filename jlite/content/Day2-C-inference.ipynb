    "# Workbook 2-C: ARG inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ARG inference is a difficult problem, a number of software programs have been developed in recent years that make a reasonable job at ARG inference. Currently, we recommend either [_SINGER_](https://github.com/popgenmethods/SINGER) (for smaller datasets) or [_tsinfer_](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tsinfer) (coupled with [_tsdate_](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tsdate)) for larger datasets. Both of these approaches output tree sequences. You might also like to consider [Relate](https://myersgroup.github.io/relate/), which has been used extensively in analysis of recent human history (and which can convert output, albeit inefficiently, to _tskit_ format). These three software programs have the same basic requirements: phased data and knowledge of the ancestral state, but are based on very different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ___SINGER___ takes a statistical sample of likely ARGs using MCMC sampling. That means it is pretty computationally intensive, so will only work on sample sizes of tens or hundreds of genomes. As _SINGER_ takes a sampling appraoch, it outputs multiple possible ARGs, which are sampled using the coalescent with recombination as a probabilistic model. Testing suggests that this provides the most accurate results.\n",
    "* ___Tsinfer___, in contrast, creates a single \"best guess\" ARG using a heuristic approach based on ancestor reconstruction. It does not attempt to estimate times of nodes in the ARG, and unlike _SINGER_, it is therefore not dependent on coalescent assumptions. For many purposes, node times are important, and a separate algorithm, _tsdate_, can be used to infer node times under the molecular clock. We will be use extremly recent versions of the two pieces of software, such that their offical documentation may not yet be up-to-date. The major drawback of the _tsinfer_+_tsdate_ approach is that rather than outputting multiple ARGs, it expresses uncertainty by using *polytomies* (nodes with more than one child). Many analysis approaches are not designed for use on trees with polytomies.\n",
    "* ___Relate___ also uses a heuristic approach, which essentially involves building separate trees along the genome and then combining them together (but this results in very inefficient tree sequences, with low amounts of correlation between adjacent trees). It also outputs a single ARG, but polytomies are fully resolved, even in the absence of strong evidence for how to resolve them. The accuracy of results is on a par with the latest _tsinfer_+_tsdate_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook, we will focus on using the fastest and most efficient method: _tsinfer_ + _tsdate_. Further, advanced workbooks will introduce _SINGER_. To illustrate, we will use the same simulation as we previously encountered, and inpect the quality of the inference by comparing the dates of the nodes below each mutation."
