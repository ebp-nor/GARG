        - answer: "roughly 4 Ne"
          correct: true
          feedback: >-
            Yes, this is the expected value as the number of samples tends to infinity. In other words
            as you increase the number of samples past 2, you only expect to double the mean TMRCA.
        - answer: "roughly Ne"

            Incorrect: as you increase the number of samples, the mean MRCA for all samples should increase

        Calculate the expected $T_{MRCA}$ for a coalescent tree with

        to the $T_{MRCA}$ for 10 samples. What implication does this
        have for the effect of sampling more sequences?

            Correct! Let $H_{10}=2(1-1/10)$ and $H_{11}=2(1-1/11)$ be
            the expected $T_{MRCA}$ of the tree with 10 samples and 11
            samples, respectively. Then the relative increase is
            $(H_{11} - H_{10})/H_{10}$.

            Adding more samples does not add substantially to the
            $T_{MRCA}$ when, say, $n>10$, but rather adds coalescent
            event close to the bottom of the tree. It is more
            important to add sites than samples to study genetic
            variation.
