  tmrca:
    - question: >-
        Calculate the expected $T_{MRCA}$ for a coalescent tree with
        $n=10$ samples. How much would an 11th sample add to the
        $T_{MRCA}$? Answer in terms of relative increase (in percent)
        to the $T_{MRCA}$ for 10 samples. What implication does this
        have for the effect of sampling more sequences?
      type: numeric
      answers:
        - type: range
          correct: true
          range: [1.009, 1.011]
          feedback: >-
            Correct! Let $H_{10}=2(1-1/10)$ and $H_{11}=2(1-1/11)$ be
            the expected $T_{MRCA}$ of the tree with 10 samples and 11
            samples, respectively. Then the relative increase is
            $(H_{11} - H_{10})/H_{10}$.

            Adding more samples does not add substantially to the
            $T_{MRCA}$ when, say, $n>10$, but rather adds coalescent
            event close to the bottom of the tree. It is more
            important to add sites than samples to study genetic
            variation.

          feedback: >-
            Correct! There are two mutations on the branch from sample
            1 to its ancestor. Since there is no explicit ordering of
            mutations, any sequence with two derived states
            (two 1's) is correct.

        Same for sample 0, but now you order mutations from left to right?

        - answer: "001100"
          correct: true
          feedback: >-
            Correct! There are 0 mutations on the branch from sample 0
            to its ancestor 5, followed by two on the branch from 5 to
            the MRCA. Since we (arbitrarily) order mutations from left
            to right, the sequence is 001100.
