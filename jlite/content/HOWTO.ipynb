    "\n",
    "This document describes the intended use of the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks (we will also call them <em>workbooks</em>) that we will be using during the exercises. Common to all workbooks is that you will need to initialize them by executing code before proceeding with the actual exercises. Cells are executed by selecting Run->\"Run selected cell\" or by pressing the triangular \"play\" button in the menubar. A shortcut for either of these is to press keys <b>&lt;shift&gt;+&lt;return&gt;</b>."

    "\n",
    "There are three ways to run the notebooks\n",
    "* Directly in the browser using a JupyterLab distribution called [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is the easiest, as it means you don't have to install anything locally on your computer to complete the exercises. However, some packages such as _SLiM_ and _tsinfer_ cannot be run in this way. An online [python.ipynb](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/notebooks/index.html?path=python.ipynb) notebook showcases some of the features of this distribution.\n",
    "* In <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">Google Colab</a>. For this, you must set up a shortcut to \"[GARG_workshop](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15rTZoXbutKF79XiE7J3mDo1zGcsoULXB?usp=share_link)\" in \"My Drive\" on your Google drive account (you will need a google username). Click on the GARG workshop link above, log in to google, right click the GARG_workshop folder and select Organise->Add shortcut, and place the shortcut directly into in your \"My Drive\" folder.\n",
    "* On your local machine, e.g. by downloading or cloning the [Github repository](https://github.com/ebp-nor/GARG) (notebooks are in `jlite/content`). This is the most flexible, but you will have to make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install dependencies from the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ebp-nor/pgip-jlite/blob/main/requirements.txt) with, e.g., pip:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r https://github.com/ebp-nor/GARG/raw/main/jlite/requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up, run the code below, which will figure out which method you are using, and install or make available the correct packages. If you are running on Colab, you may need to permit access to your google drive files (\"Connect to Google Drive\")."
