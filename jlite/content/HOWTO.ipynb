    "# HOWTO\n",
    "\n",
    "This document describes the intended use of the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks (we will also call them <em>workbooks</em>) that we will be using during the exercises. The notebooks are powered by a JupyterLab distribution called [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that runs <b>directly in the browser</b>. This means you don't have to install anything locally on your computer to complete the exercises. You can of course download the notebooks to run locally, but then you yourself have to make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install dependencies from the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/percyfal/pgip-jlite/blob/main/requirements.txt) with, e.g., pip:\n",
