  abstract = {Evolutionary genetics considers the causes of evolutionary change and the nature of variability in evolution. The methods of evolutionary genetics are critically important for the analysis and interpretation of the massive datasets on DNA sequence variation and evolution that are becoming available, as well for our understanding of evolution in general. This book shows readers how models of the genetic processes involved in evolution are made (including natural selection, migration, mutation, and genetic drift in finite populations), and how the models are used to interpret classical and molecular genetic data. The material is intended for advanced level undergraduate courses in genetics and evolutionary biology, graduate students in evolutionary biology and human genetics, and researchers in related fields who wish to learn evolutionary genetics. The topics covered include genetic variation, DNA sequence variability and its measurement, the different types of natural selection and their effects (e.g. the maintenance of variation, directional selection, and adaptation), the interactions between selection and mutation or migration, the description and analysis of variation at multiple sites in the genome, genetic drift, and the effects of spatial structure. The final two chapters demonstrate how the theory illuminates our understanding of the evolution of breeding systems, sex ratios and life histories, and some aspects of genome evolution.},

The ancestral recombination graph is a detailed description of the coalescence and recombination events that define the relationships among the sampled sequences. This rich description is useful for a wide variety of population genetic analyses. We describe the preparation of data and major considerations for running ARGweaver, as well as the interpretation of results. We then demonstrate an analysis using the DARC (Duffy) gene as an example, and show how ARGweaver can be used to detect signatures of natural selection and Neandertal introgression, as well as to estimate the dates of mutation events. This chapter provides sufficient detail to get a new user up and running with this complex but powerful analysis tool.},

But how important is selection, is it really so trivial to understand and what are the alternatives? Here I discuss how genetics is crucial for addressing all of these questions: genetics allowed the concept of natural selection to become viable, it contributed to our understanding of the complexities of selection and it spurred the development of competing models of evolution. Understanding how and why selection acts has important potential applications, from understanding the mechanisms of disease and microbial resistance, to improving the design of transgenes and drugs.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the rate of point mutation is of fundamental importance, because mutations are a vital source of genetic novelty and a significant cause of human diseases. Currently, mutation rate is thought to vary many fold among genes within a genome and among lineages in mammals. We have conducted a computational analysis of 5,669 genes (17,208 sequences) from species representing major groups of placental mammals to characterize the extent of mutation rate differences among genes in a genome and among diverse mammalian lineages. We find that mutation rate is approximately constant per year and largely similar among genes. Similarity of mutation rates among lineages with vastly different generation lengths and physiological attributes points to a much greater contribution of replication-independent mutational processes to the overall mutation rate. Our results suggest that the average mammalian genome mutation rate is 2.2 \texttimes{} 10-9 per base pair per year, which provides further opportunities for estimating species and population divergence times by using molecular clocks.},

  abstract = {The effect of genetic mutation on phenotype is of significant interest in genetics. The type of genetic mutation that causes a single amino acid substitution (AAS) in a protein sequence is called a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP). An nsSNP could potentially affect the function of the protein, subsequently altering the carrier's phenotype. This protocol describes the use of the 'Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant' (SIFT) algorithm in predicting whether an AAS affects protein function. To assess the effect of a substitution, SIFT assumes that important positions in a protein sequence have been conserved throughout evolution and therefore substitutions at these positions may affect protein function. Thus, by using sequence homology, SIFT predicts the effects of all possible substitutions at each position in the protein sequence. The protocol typically takes 5\textendash 20 min, depending on the input. SIFT is available as an online tool (http://sift-dna.org).},

  abstract = {Few doubt that effective population size (Ne) is one of the most important parameters in evolutionary biology, but how many can say they really understand the concept? Ne is the evolutionary analog of the number of individuals (or adults) in the population, N. Whereas ecological consequences of population size depend on N, evolutionary consequences (rates of loss of genetic diversity and increase in inbreeding; relative effectiveness of selection) depend on Ne. Formal definitions typically relate effective size to a key population genetic parameter, such as loss of heterozygosity or variance in allele frequency. However, for practical application to real populations, it is more useful to define Ne in terms of 3 demographic parameters: number of potential parents (adult N), and mean and variance in offspring number. Defined this way, Ne determines the rate of random genetic drift across the entire genome in the offspring generation. Other evolutionary forces (mutation, migration, selection)\textemdash together with factors such as variation in recombination rate\textemdash can also affect genetic variation, and this leads to heterogeneity across the genome in observed rates of genetic change. For some, it has been convenient to interpret this heterogeneity in terms of heterogeneity in Ne, but unfortunately, this has muddled the concepts of genetic drift and effective population size. A commonly repeated misconception is that Ne is the number of parents that actually contribute genes to the next generation (NP). In reality, NP can be smaller or larger than Ne, and the NP/Ne ratio depends on the sex ratio, the mean and variance in offspring number, and whether inbreeding or variance Ne is of interest.},

To better understand the effects of a bottleneck on a free-ranging carnivore population, we used 24 microsatellite loci to compare genetic diversity before versus during the bottleneck, and compare the last wild population to two historical populations. We also compared genetic diversity in black-footed ferrets to that of two sibling species, the steppe polecat (Mustela eversmanni) and the European polecat (Mustela putorius). Black-footed ferrets during the bottleneck had less genetic diversity than steppe polecats. The three black-footed ferret populations were well differentiated (FST = 0.57 {$\pm$} 0.15; mean {$\pm$} SE). We attributed the decrease in genetic diversity in black-footed ferrets to localized extinction of these genetically distinct subpopulations and to the bottleneck in the surviving subpopulation. Although genetic diversity decreased, female fecundity and juvenile survival were not affected by the population bottleneck.},
