## Preparation

In preparation for the workshop, please make sure to work through the
workbooks listed below. In addition, we recommend you go through the
suggested readings.

### Workbooks

The workbooks can be run either as a
[JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) instance
or in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Keep in mind
that you need a Google account to run the Colab exercies. Run the
HOWTO first (it takes 5-10 minutes), preferably in both engines, to
make sure everything works as expected and you understand the format
of the workbooks.

```{r }
#| label: r-list-workbooks
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: asis
workbooks <- data.frame(
  Topic = c(
    "HOWTO - introduction to exercises and JupyterLite",
    "An introduction to Python"
  ),
  link_lab_jlite = c(
    "HOWTO.ipynb",
    "python_intro.ipynb"
  ),
  link_lab_colab = c(
    "HOWTO.ipynb",
    "python_intro.ipynb"
  )
)

workbooks_md <- workbooks %>%
  # create links
  dplyr::mutate(link_lab_jlite = ifelse(
    is.na(link_lab_jlite), NA,
    gsub(
      ",", "",
      gsub(
        "([^,]+)",
        paste0(
          " **[{{< fa brands firefox-browser >}}](",
          server, "\\1)**"
        ),
        link_lab_jlite
      )
    )
  )) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(link_lab_colab = ifelse(
    is.na(link_lab_colab), NA,
    gsub(
      ",", "",
      gsub(
        "([^,]+)",
        paste0(
          " **[{{< fa brands google >}}](",
          colabhost, "\\1)**"
        ),
        link_lab_colab
      )
    )
  ))
cat(
  print(kable(workbooks_md,
    format = "pipe", escape = FALSE,
    row.names = FALSE,
    col.names = c("Topic", "JupyterLite", "Google Colab")
  )),
  "\n\n: {.hover .condensed .responsive tbl-colwidths=\"[60, 20, 20]\"}\n\n"
)
