## Preparation

In preparation for the workshop, please make sure to work through the
workbooks listed below. In addition, we recommend you go through the
suggested readings.

### Workbooks

The exercise workbooks have been prepared as [Jupyter
notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). The workbooks can be run either as a
[JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) instance
or in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Keep in mind
that you need a Google account to run the Colab exercies. Run the
HOWTO first (it takes 5-10 minutes), preferably in both engines, to
make sure everything works as expected and you understand the format
of the workbooks. There is also a link to download the workbooks in
which case you need a Jupyter installation on your computer to run.
